# Prevent-Spread
My team and I have participated in a Homathon that related to Covid-19 with this idea: building a tracker app.  During the quarantine period, some people have emergency reasons, and they need to be out. Therefore, they highly susceptible to get infected and transmission of infection to others. Our proposed solution was an app called Prevent Spread. This app gives movement permission and tracks users' locations.    First of all, all permits can be submitted electronically by fill a form to make a request using the Prevent Spread app. Then the Ministry of Interior Affairs will decide whether to approve or disapprove it. In the case of approval, the Prevent Spread app will track users by saving their locations on a database. So, if the permit holder got infected with the virus, it will be easier for the competent authority to predict the possible infected.  My role in this was coding. I have designed three simple interfaces. Welcome page(Activity), login, and locations track to show the map and save locations on a local database.
